*Automate anything without learning to code. Record once, replay forever.*

AmbientOps Composer is a visual workflow builder for creating complex system automation. Drag nodes, wire connections, and build powerful workflows—no programming required. When you need more control, generated D code is there for you.

"You know what you want your computer to do. Why should you need to learn programming to make it happen?"
____

== The Problem

You want to automate repetitive tasks:

* "Check disk space every morning, clean up if above 90%"
* "If network is slow, run diagnostics and send me a report"
* "Back up my configs before any system changes, auto-rollback if something breaks"
* "Monitor CPU usage, optimize processes if sustained high load"

You have three bad options:

1. **Learn shell scripting** — Months of learning, easy to make dangerous mistakes
2. **Copy-paste forum code** — Don't understand what it does, might break your system
3. **Give up** — Do it manually forever, lose time every day

**AmbientOps Composer solves this.**

== What It Does

AmbientOps Composer provides a *visual, zero-code interface* for building system automation workflows using AmbientOps tools as building blocks.

=== 🎨 Visual Flow Editor

Build workflows by dragging and connecting nodes:

[source,text]
----
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Schedule   │────▶│ Check Disk   │────▶│  If > 90%   │
│ Daily @ 8am │     │    Space     │     │             │

                                         └──────┬───────┘
                                                │
                                                ▼
                                         ┌──────────────┐
                                         │ Email Report │
                                         └──────────────┘
----

No code. Just logic.

=== 🎯 Zero-Code Interface

Everything is visual:

* **Triggers**: When should this workflow run? (time, event, manual)
* **Operations**: What should it do? (check disk, run diagnostics, backup files)
* **Logic**: When should branches execute? (if/then/else, loops, switches)
* **Outputs**: Where do results go? (notifications, logs, emails, webhooks)

If you can draw a flowchart, you can build automations.

=== 📹 Macro Recorder

Watch and learn:

1. Click "Record Workflow"
2. Perform your tasks manually (run commands, check outputs, make decisions)
3. Composer captures every action
4. Convert to a reusable workflow
5. Adjust timing, add conditions, save as template

Record your expertise once. Replay it forever.

=== 💡 Context-Sensitive Help

Never feel lost:

* Hover over any node for documentation
* See inline examples for every operation
* Real-time validation ("This won't work because...")
* Suggest common patterns ("Users often add X after Y")
* Link to full tool documentation

Help exactly when you need it, nowhere else.

=== 🔄 Bidirectional Script Generation

Visual flows compile to clean D code:

[source,d]
----
// Generated by AmbientOps Composer v0.1.0
// Workflow: Daily Disk Cleanup
// Created: 2026-01-29

import ambientops.schedule;
import ambientops.disk;
import ambientops.notify;

void dailyDiskCleanup() {
    auto diskUsage = checkDiskSpace("/");

    if (diskUsage.percentUsed > 90) {
        auto cleaned = cleanTempFiles();
        sendEmail("admin@example.com",
                  "Disk cleaned",
                  format("Freed %d MB", cleaned.freedMB));
    }
}

// Schedule: Every day at 08:00
schedule("0 8 * * *", &dailyDiskCleanup);
----

You can edit the code. Changes sync back to the visual editor (when possible).

== Real-World Workflows

=== Workflow 1: "Fix Network Every Morning if Slow"

**Visual Flow:**

[source,text]
----
Schedule (7am) → Test Speed → If < 50 Mbps → Run Repair → Email Report
----

**What It Does:**

* Every morning at 7 AM
* Tests network speed
* If below 50 Mbps threshold
* Runs network diagnostics + auto-repair
* Emails you the results

**Use Case:** You wake up to either "everything fine" or "fixed the network" email.

=== Workflow 2: "Monitor Disk, Alert at 90%, Cleanup at 95%"

**Visual Flow:**

[source,text]
----
Schedule (hourly) → Check Disk → Switch on usage:
    - > 95%: Clean temp + email urgent alert
    - > 90%: Email warning + show top 10 files
    - < 90%: Log "OK"
----

**What It Does:**

* Checks disk space every hour
* If above 95%: emergency cleanup (temp files, cache), urgent email
* If 90-95%: warning email with largest files list
* If below 90%: just log status

**Use Case:** Never fill your disk accidentally. Graduated response.

=== Workflow 3: "Security Audit Weekly, Email Report"

**Visual Flow:**

[source,text]
----
Schedule (Sun 8am) → Run Security Audit → Generate PDF Report → Email to team
----

**What It Does:**

* Every Sunday at 8 AM
* Runs comprehensive security audit (AmbientOps security tools)
* Generates PDF report with findings
* Emails report to team@ distribution list

**Use Case:** Automated security compliance, weekly audit trail.

=== Workflow 4: "Performance Check on High CPU, Auto-Optimize"

**Visual Flow:**

[source,text]
----
Condition Watch (CPU > 80% for 5 min) → Identify Heavy Processes →
    If (safe to optimize) → Apply Fixes → Notify User
    Else → Email Admin for Manual Review
----

**What It Does:**

* Continuously monitors CPU usage
* Triggers when CPU > 80% sustained for 5 minutes
* Identifies heavy processes
* Checks if auto-optimization is safe (no critical processes)
* If safe: applies CPU throttling, deprioritizes background tasks
* If unsafe: sends alert to admin
* Notifies user of action taken

**Use Case:** Laptop overheating during work, auto-fixes without manual intervention.

=== Workflow 5: "Backup Configs Before Changes, Rollback if Fails"

**Visual Flow:**

[source,text]
----
Manual Trigger → Backup /etc → Try:
    - Apply Changes
    - Verify System Healthy
    Catch (on failure):
    - Restore Backup
    - Email Error Report
----

**What It Does:**

* Triggered manually before risky system changes
* Backs up /etc and other config directories
* Attempts the changes
* Verifies system is still healthy (network up, services running)
* If anything fails: auto-restores backup, sends error report
* If success: keeps backup for 7 days

**Use Case:** Fearless config editing with safety net.

== Template Library

Common workflows pre-built:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Template |Description

|**Daily Health Check**
|Morning report: system status, network health, disk space, security alerts

|**Backup Everything**
|Nightly backup of /home, /etc, databases; verify integrity; clean old backups

|**Network Guardian**
|Monitor network 24/7, auto-repair on failure, alert if repair fails

|**Disk Space Manager**
|Hourly disk check, graduated cleanup (temp → cache → old logs → downloads)

|**Security Watchdog**
|Weekly audit, continuous permission monitoring, alert on suspicious changes

|**Performance Optimizer**
|Monitor CPU/RAM, identify bottlenecks, auto-optimize when safe

|**Package Update Robot**
|Weekly updates, verify GPG signatures, backup before upgrade, rollback on failure

|**Log Analyzer**
|Daily log search for errors, categorize issues, email summary

|**Service Health Monitor**
|Check critical services (web server, database, etc.), auto-restart on failure

|**Pre-Deployment Checklist**
|Before deploys: backup, verify disk space, check network, confirm services healthy
|===

Click "New from Template", adjust to your needs, deploy.

== Integration with AmbientOps

AmbientOps Composer is the *orchestration layer* for the AmbientOps ecosystem:

=== Integrates With

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |How Composer Uses It

|**Network Ambulance**
|Network diagnostic and repair operations as draggable nodes

|**Traffic Conditioner**
|Bandwidth testing, QoS configuration, latency measurement nodes

|**Operating Theatre**
|Composer workflows become "procedures" in the Operating Theatre

|**Ward**
|Read health metrics, trigger workflows on threshold breaches, send results to dashboard

|**Emergency Room**
|Panic button can trigger Composer workflows (e.g., "Full System Diagnostic")

|**Records**
|Workflow execution logs integrate with Records for audit trails, undo receipts
|===

=== Philosophy Alignment

Composer follows AmbientOps principles:

* **Evidence-first**: Workflows show what they will do before doing it (test mode)
* **Non-destructive**: Automatic backups, reversible actions
* **Explicit approval**: Workflows require user approval for dangerous operations
* **No security holes**: Cannot open firewall ports without explicit consent node

See `docs/AMBIENTOPS_INTEGRATION.adoc` for technical details.

== Features

=== Test Mode (Dry-Run)

Test entire workflow without changing anything:

[source,bash]
----
ambientops-composer test-workflow daily-cleanup
----

Shows:

* What each node would do
* What conditions would evaluate to
* What outputs would be generated
* Estimated execution time
* Potential errors/warnings

Fix issues before deploying.

=== Real-Time Execution Monitoring

Watch workflows run live:

[source,text]
----
Workflow: Daily Health Check
Status: Running (step 3/7)

✓ Trigger: Schedule fired at 07:00:02
✓ Check Network: OK (10ms latency, 95 Mbps down)
→ Check Disk: Running... 47% complete
  - Analyzing /home: 234 GB / 512 GB used
  - Analyzing /var: ...
----

See progress in real-time, inspect outputs at each step.

=== Debugging (Step Through)

Debug workflows interactively:

1. Click "Debug" on workflow
2. Execution pauses at each node
3. Inspect variables, outputs, conditions
4. Step forward/over/out (like code debugger)
5. Modify values on-the-fly (test edge cases)

Fix logic errors visually.

=== Workflow Versioning

Every edit creates a new version:

[source,bash]
----
$ ambientops-composer list-versions daily-cleanup

Version  Date                Author    Status      Changes
v5       2026-01-29 14:23   user      deployed    Added email notification
v4       2026-01-27 09:15   user      archived    Changed disk threshold
v3       2026-01-25 16:42   user      archived    Fixed condition logic
v2       2026-01-22 11:03   user      archived    Added backup step
v1       2026-01-20 08:30   user      archived    Initial version
----

Rollback to any version:

[source,bash]
----
ambientops-composer rollback daily-cleanup --version v4
----

Never lose working workflows.

=== Share Workflows

Export workflows for sharing:

[source,bash]
----
ambientops-composer export network-guardian network-guardian.workflow
----

Import on another system:

[source,bash]
----
ambientops-composer import network-guardian.workflow
----

Share with team, post to forums, contribute to template library.

=== Workflow Permissions

Control who can edit/run workflows:

[source,bash]
----
# Only admin can edit, anyone can run
ambientops-composer set-permissions backup-everything --edit admin --run everyone

# Only specific user can run
ambientops-composer set-permissions deploy-to-prod --run alice
----

Multi-user safety.

----

=== Backend

* **Language**: D (robust, cross-platform, good metaprogramming)
* **Execution**: Compiles workflows to D scripts (JIT or ahead-of-time)
* **Storage**: SQLite (workflow definitions, versions, execution logs)
* **Scheduler**: Built-in cron-like scheduler (no external dependencies)

=== Frontend

**Terminal UI (default):**

* Library: notcurses (rich TUI, mouse support, works over SSH)
* Responsive: Works on small terminals (80x24) and large screens
* Keyboard-first: Vim-like navigation (also mouse support)

**Web UI (optional):**

* Lightweight HTTP server (D's vibe.d or similar)
* No external dependencies (bundled assets)
* Works on localhost only by default (security)
* Can enable network access with `--listen 0.0.0.0` (if trusted network)

=== Generated Scripts

Workflows compile to readable D code:

* Uses AmbientOps libraries (same APIs as manual coding)
* Includes comments explaining each step
* Can be edited manually (advanced users)
* Changes sync back to visual editor (best-effort)

Example round-trip:

1. Build visual workflow in Composer
2. Export to D code, edit in text editor
3. Re-import to Composer (shows visual representation)

=== Requirements

* D compiler (dmd, ldc, or gdc)
* notcurses (for TUI) or web browser (for Web UI)
* AmbientOps tools (network-ambulance, traffic-conditioner, etc.)
* SQLite (bundled with most systems)

=== Supported Platforms

* ✓ Linux (primary target)
* ⚠ macOS (limited testing)
* ✗ Windows (not supported; use WSL2)

== Safety Features

=== Execution Sandboxing

Workflows cannot:

* Delete files outside specified paths
* Modify system files without explicit permission nodes
* Open network ports (unless explicit node)
* Install packages (unless explicit node)
* Run as root (unless explicit sudo node + approval)

Dangerous operations require:

1. Explicit node in workflow
2. User approval at design time
3. Confirmation at runtime (for destructive actions)

=== Validation

Before deploying:

* ✓ Syntax check (no invalid node connections)
* ✓ Logic check (no infinite loops, unreachable nodes)
* ✓ Permissions check (has required privileges)
* ✓ Dependency check (required tools installed)
* ✓ Safety check (flags dangerous patterns)

Fix issues before deployment.

=== Approval Gates

Workflows can pause for human approval:

[source,text]
----
Backup Configs → Apply Changes → Wait for Approval → Deploy to Production
----

"Wait for Approval" node sends notification, workflow pauses until approved.

=== Execution Limits

Prevent runaway workflows:

* Max execution time (default: 1 hour)
* Max loop iterations (default: 10,000)
* Max concurrent workflows (default: 10)
* Rate limiting (prevent triggering too often)

Configurable per workflow.

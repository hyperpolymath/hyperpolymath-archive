:description: A curated collection of asdf plugins for modern development workflows
:keywords: asdf, version manager, plugins, polyglot, development tools

== Welcome to the Control Tower

The **asdf-control-tower** is the central hub for managing and coordinating the hyperpolymath collection of asdf plugins. We provide high-quality, well-maintained plugins for developers who need reliable version management across multiple tools and languages.

=== What is asdf?

https://asdf-vm.com[asdf] is an extendable version manager that supports multiple languages and tools through a plugin system. Instead of managing separate version managers for each language (nvm, rbenv, pyenv, etc.), asdf provides a single interface for all.

=== Our Philosophy

* **Quality over quantity** - Each plugin is thoroughly tested and maintained
* **Security first** - SHA verification, secure downloads, supply chain integrity
* **Community driven** - Open source under MPL-2.0
* **Multi-platform mirrors** - Available on GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, and Bitbucket

=== Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

The control tower uses a hub-and-spoke model for source control management:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Hub | GitHub (primary development)
| Spoke | GitLab mirror
| Spoke | Codeberg mirror
| Spoke | Bitbucket mirror
|===

This ensures our plugins remain accessible even if one platform experiences issues.

=== Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
# Install asdf (see asdf-vm.com for your platform)

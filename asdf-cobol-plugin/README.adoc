https://asdf-vm.com[asdf] plugin for https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucobol/[GnuCOBOL].

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Project Status: Specification Pending*

This repository is a placeholder. The plugin implementation will be uploaded shortly.

== Overview

This plugin will enable version management of GnuCOBOL via the asdf version manager, allowing developers to:

* Install multiple GnuCOBOL versions side-by-side
* Switch between versions per-project or globally
* Ensure reproducible COBOL development environments

== Planned Installation

Once implemented:

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add cobol https://gitlab.com/hyperpolymath/asdf-cobol.git
asdf list-all cobol
asdf install cobol 3.2.0
asdf global cobol 3.2.0
----

== What Is Missing (Pending Implementation)

Standard asdf plugin structure requires:

[source]
----
bin/
├── download      # Fetch GnuCOBOL source tarball
├── install       # Compile and install GnuCOBOL
├── list-all      # List available versions
├── list-bin-paths # (optional) Expose binaries
└── exec-env      # (optional) Set runtime environment
----

== About GnuCOBOL

GnuCOBOL (formerly OpenCOBOL) is a free COBOL compiler that translates COBOL source to C, then compiles with a native C compiler. It implements substantial portions of the COBOL 85, COBOL 2002, and COBOL 2014 standards.

Key features:

* COBOL 85/2002/2014 support
* Compiles to native code via C
* Interoperability with C libraries
* Active development and community

== Multi-Forge Distribution

* *Primary*: https://gitlab.com/hyperpolymath/asdf-cobol[GitLab]
* *Mirror*: GitHub (hyperpolymath/asdf-cobol-plugin)

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based

We use consensus-based decision making:

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes via issues or discussions
2. **Discussion**: Community discusses the proposal
3. **Consensus**: Maintainers reach consensus (not unanimous vote)
4. **Implementation**: Approved proposals are implemented

### Voting

For significant decisions where consensus cannot be reached:

- Simple majority of active maintainers
- Lead maintainer has tie-breaking vote
- All maintainers must be notified

### Significant Decisions

These require explicit maintainer consensus:

- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Major architectural changes
- Addition/removal of dependencies
- Changes to contribution guidelines
- Addition/removal of maintainers
- License changes

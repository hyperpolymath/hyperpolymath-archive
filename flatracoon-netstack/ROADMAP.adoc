Strategic roadmap for the FlatRacoon Network Stack.

toc::[]

== Current Status (2026-01-22)

**Phase:** 🟢 Production Ready (Seam Smoothing)
**Completion:** 100% of core components
**Focus:** Quality improvements and enterprise-grade polish

=== ✅ Completed Milestones

==== v0.1.0 - Foundation (COMPLETE)
* ✅ Core orchestrator functionality (Elixir/Phoenix)
* ✅ TUI with real HTTP client (Ada/SPARK, 250KB binary)
* ✅ Interface SDK (Deno/ReScript)
* ✅ Network modules deployed (ZeroTier, Twingate, IPFS)
* ✅ Basic documentation
* ✅ CI/CD pipeline (stack integration tests)
* ✅ Deployment guide
* ✅ MCP integration layer (k8s, secret, observability, iac, db)

==== v0.2.0 - Integration (COMPLETE)
* ✅ Orchestrator REST API (deploy, restart, stop, logs)
* ✅ TUI HTTP client with JSON parsing
* ✅ Interface SDK client library
* ✅ Stack-level integration testing
* ✅ End-to-end deployment documentation
* ✅ Module health aggregation
* ✅ Deployment order resolution

== Current Focus: Seam Smoothing Phase

The stack is **functionally complete** at 100%. All core components are operational
and production-ready for controlled environments.

The current phase focuses on *smoothing, sealing, and shining* the integration seams
to achieve enterprise-grade quality.

See link:SEAM_ANALYSIS.adoc[SEAM_ANALYSIS.adoc] for comprehensive analysis.

=== Phase 1: Important Seams (Week 1-3)

**Priority:** 🟡 Important (7 items)

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Item | Description | Effort

| Interface SDK JSON parsing
| Implement real JSON decoders (not placeholders)
| 1-2 hours

| Orchestrator deployment verification
| Check kubectl/helm exit codes, poll deployment status
| 1-2 hours

| HTTP error code handling
| Parse HTTP response codes in TUI (404, 500, 503)
| 1-2 hours

| Configuration standardization
| Use `/etc/flatracoon/` and `~/.config/flatracoon/`
| 1-2 hours

| Module auto-discovery
| Scan `/etc/flatracoon/modules.d/` for manifests
| 4-8 hours

| Integration test coverage
| End-to-end smoke tests (TUI → orchestrator → kubectl)
| 4-8 hours

| TUI JSON parsing improvement
| Use proper JSON library (json-ada or gnatcoll-json)
| 4-8 hours
|===

**Timeline:** 1-3 weeks
**Outcome:** Enhanced robustness and user experience

=== Phase 2: Nice-to-have Improvements (Week 4+)

**Priority:** 🟢 Nice-to-have (12 items)

**Quick Wins (1-2 hours each):**
- ANSI color validation in TUI
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Environment variable naming consistency
- License header audit (PMPL compliance)

**Medium Effort (4-8 hours each):**
- Connection pooling for TUI
- TypeScript definitions for SDK
- Command autocompletion (bash/zsh)
- API documentation generation (ExDoc + OpenAPI)
- Architecture diagrams (C4 model)

**Large Improvements (1-2 days each):**
- TLS and authentication
- Load testing suite
- Consistent error format across components

== Future Milestones

=== v0.3.0 - Polish & Hardening (Q1 2026)

**Goals:**
- Complete Phase 1 seam smoothing (all 🟡 Important items)
- Address high-priority 🟢 Nice-to-have items
- Performance benchmarking
- User feedback incorporation

**Deliverables:**
- Robust JSON parsing across all components
- HTTP error handling in TUI
- Module auto-discovery
- Enhanced integration tests
- Configuration standardization
- Architecture diagrams

=== v0.4.0 - Enterprise Features (Q2 2026)

**Goals:**
- TLS support in orchestrator
- API key authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging
- Connection pooling
- Load testing results

**Deliverables:**
- Production security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive observability
- TypeScript definitions for SDK
- API documentation (OpenAPI spec)

=== v1.0.0 - Stable Release (Q3 2026)

**Goals:**
- All seams smoothed (0 🟡, minimal 🟢)
- Production deployments validated
- Community feedback incorporated
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance benchmarks published

**Criteria for v1.0:**
- [ ] Zero critical or important seams remaining
- [ ] All nice-to-have polish items evaluated
- [ ] Load testing completed (known scaling limits)
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Multi-site production deployment validated
- [ ] API stability guarantees
- [ ] Breaking change policy established

=== v2.0.0 - Extended Modules (Q4 2026+)

**Goals:**
- Complete remaining network modules:
  - ipv6-site-enforcer
  - hesiod-dns-map
  - bgp-backbone-lab
  - network-dashboard
- FlatRacoon OS integration (if research phase completes)

**Deliverables:**
- Full stack with all 8 network modules
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- IPv6-only enforcement
- BGP routing simulation
- Hesiod service discovery

== Principles Guiding Roadmap

**Quality over Speed:**
- Polish existing functionality before adding new features
- Address seams systematically (Critical → Important → Nice-to-have)
- Validate production readiness through real deployments

**Community-Driven:**
- Incorporate user feedback from early adopters
- Prioritize pain points identified in production
- Document common use cases and patterns

**Sustainable Pace:**
- Avoid feature creep
- Maintain 100% completion on all production components
- Only add new modules when core is proven stable

== Contributing to Roadmap

See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md] for how to:
- Propose new features
- Report production issues
- Contribute seam smoothing fixes
- Add architecture improvements

Roadmap priorities are adjusted based on:
1. Production deployment feedback
2. Security concerns
3. User experience issues
4. Performance bottlenecks
5. Community requests
